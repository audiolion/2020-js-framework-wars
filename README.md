# 2020 JS Framework Wars

The goal is to build a simple image search app in various JS frameworks and compare them. Each app should meet the following requirements:

- [ ] Setup
- [ ] User Input, DOM Events
  - [ ] Retrieve the search term from the input when the form is submitted
- [ ] Conditional Rendering
  - [ ] Show loading image when form is submitted
- [ ] API Requests
  - [ ] Request the images from the API with the given search term
- [ ] Rendering Lists of Data
  - [ ] Append the API results to the page
- [ ] Conditional Rendering
  - [ ] Hide loading image

- [x] Vanilla JS (not a framework lol)
- [x] React.js
- [x] Vue.js
- [x] Svelte.js
- [ ] Angular.js
